# Network Concepts

## Ingress Filtering

It is important to filter all ingress data not specifically required for services provided by the protected network to function (e.g., a web hosting provider, HTTP port 80).

## Egress Filtering

The filtering of packets originating inside the firewall. This is an important part of enforcing acceptable use policies, and reducing the risk that any malware or infected hosts can attack hosts outside the firewall (e.g., prevent malware-infected Windows zombies from participating in external DDoS attacks).

## Bridging

Bridging is the act of aggregating multiples networks to single network

## Forwarding

forwardig the packets one host to another host with different ports

## NAT

it's process of translating the privates address into TCp header to hide a host or netowkr in a private network
