# CRDs and Operators

- CRDs and Operators require more permission than application
- as more growing use of CRDs and operators we should also consider the audit for this
- everytime updated new operator you shoudld follow the security scan results
- if vendor using alot of crds or operators, and doest not pass the audit, the decision must be made to accept the software or make writting exception and add trackign and dynamic tracking tools to determine when and if the osftware has been compromised.
